WD_cycle22_cycle20new.phot includes the average magnitudes from Cycle20 and
Cycle22 for the 9 Equatorial WDs, the Cycle22 magnitudes for the 3 CALSPEC WDs
and the new 14 WDs. ZPs to bring the magnitudes to infinity are indicated in
the table, as estimated by using the photometry of the 3 Bohlin standard DA WD,
GD-71, GD-153 and G191B2B.  Cycle22 magnitudes are an average of measurements
obtained with Sextractor and with ILAPH. There are two different sets of
errors. The first one, dMag1, is the weighted mean error, while the second,
dMag2, is the standard deviation of the measurements. The largest of these two
numbers from Sextractor or ILAPH is used. For the 9 Equatorial WDs, these
errors are the same for all filters where only 1 epoch was observed excluding
F275W and F160W, where three images were collected.

Note that Cycle22 photometry is done on the UVIS2 detector and Cycle20 on the
UVIS1. An offset has been applied to Cycle20 magnitudes before averaging them
with Cycle22 magnitudes.

Note that ZP_all has two sets of zeropoints - ZP_10 is from AC's calculations,
ZP_10_2017, are from MAST for a 10pix radius aperture on UVIS2.
