AC = Annalisa Calamida, using sourceextractor w/ r=7.5pix aperture
AS = Abi Saha, custom ILAPH routine w/ r=7.5pix aperture and sky with annulus from 20--30pix
Combined = weighted average measurement of AS+AC correcting for some flat
    offset object-by-object (usually 0.001-0.002 mag) with the bigger of the two
    errors. I don't actually understand this procedure.
    Zeropoints are in ZP_all.
