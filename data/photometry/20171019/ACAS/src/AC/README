From AC:

The tables include measurement derived with Sextractor (labeled as “s”) and
DAOPHOT (labeled as “d”).

The number of measurements that I have for Cycle22 stars seems larger (976)
than what is listed in Abi’s last catalog allmeasures_cy22_abi (635). But may
be this is not the last version? The number of measurements for Cycle20 stars
(108) agrees.

GN notes:

three files have minor formatting issues
- Extra # in the header column which is interpreted as part of the column name
    C20/WD-1635+008_F160W_cy20.all

- Extra integer field after Epoch (unknown meaning)
    C22/SDSS-J010322.19-002047.7_F160W_cy22.all
    C22/SDSS-J102430.93-003207.0_F160W_cy22.all
    
these extra characters can be manually edited out
