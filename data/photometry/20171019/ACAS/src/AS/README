ILAPH photometry from AS (v1 and v2 were done by AS, v3 and v4 by AS and JC)

ILAPH version key:

v1 : wrong value for gain and full well used

v2 : rectifies wrong value for gain and full well, however discovered CR rejection also seems to blotch PSF core often leading to outliers, particularly in F775W (sharpest PSF)

given these issues, v1 and v2 should not be used for any analysis. They're listed here for completeness.
The first "good" version" of photometry is ILAPHv3.

v3 : no CR rejection, also disables MAST phot scaling of UVIS2 counts to UVIS1, so this should be on the UVIS2 natural system
ILAPHv3 used 
7.5 pix aperture radius (~0.3") on UVIS2 
5 pix aperture radius (~0.65") on IR
GN thinks that the sky annulus is r=14-21 pixel radius but this should be checked since AC has r_upper=31 pixels in an email on 20180130.
This is likely just a typo.
ILAPHv3 is still the baseline for the analysis. 

v4 has no changes to the algorithm, but has tweaks ONLY to F160W with the following aperture and annulus radii.
v4a = 5 46-62
v4b = 7 46-62
v4c = 9 46-62
v4d = 5 23-46 
v4e = 4 46-62
v4f = 3 46-62
