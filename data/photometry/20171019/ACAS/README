check_phot.py : checks the photometry differences reported by AC between source extractor, DAOPHOT and ILAPHv1 (redundant)
dump_calspec_apparent_mags.py : dumps tables of apparent mags of the three CALSPEC primary standards on UVIS2 and UVIS1
dump_outliers.py : dumps tables of outliers of any photometric method (Msex, Mila, Mdao) in WD_cycle22_all.tar.gz vs other two.

AC: Annalisa Calamida's Source Extractor + DAOPHOT measures
C20 : Cycle 20 data (current, up to date)
C22 : Cycle 22 data (outdated, being updated 11/15/17) - contains ILAPHv1 as well

AS: Abi Saha's ILAPH measurements (current best = v3)
ILAPHv3.pdf : results for all objects with ILAPH

ILAPH
v1 : wrong value for gain and full well used
v2 : rectifies wrong value for gain and full well, however discovered CR rejection also seems to blotch PSF core often leading to outliers, particularly in F775W (sharpest PSF)
v3 : no CR rejection, also disables MAST phot scaling of UVIS2 counts to UVIS1, so this should be on the UVIS2 natural system
