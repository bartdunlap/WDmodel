Instead of the time-averaged mags from 20170719, this has individual epochs for sourceextractor, ilaph v1, daophot

Same aperture settings:
AC = Annalisa Calamida, using sourceextractor w/ r=7.5pix aperture
AS = Abi Saha, custom ILAPH routine w/ r=7.5pix aperture and sky with annulus from 20--30pix
