Photometry versions are stored by date, and source (where available)
AC = Annalisa Calamida
AS = Abi Saha
Combined = combined results from AC and AS analysis

The original WD_photC22.dat was solely from AC's analysis and is still available in 20170301

The 20170731/Combined release combined AC and AS results, but this wasn't well defined, and just added in new systematics

The current working release is 20171019
