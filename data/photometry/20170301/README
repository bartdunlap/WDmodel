Original photometry release from AC using sextractor only w/ r=7.5pix aperture

There's photometry for Cycle 20 and 22, as well as from Cycle 20 converted to
the Cycle 22 system with an offset per filter.

There's also zeropoints from her, but we end up using her average photometry
for the three primary standards + their standard mags to determine zeropoints.
