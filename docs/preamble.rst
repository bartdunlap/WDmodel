``WDmodel`` is a DA White Dwarf model atmosphere fitting code. It fits observed
spectrophotometry of DA White Dwarfs to infer intrinsic model atmosphere
parameters in the presence of dust and correlated spectroscopic flux
calibration errors, thereby determining full SEDs for the white dwarf. It's
primary scientific purpose is to establish a network of faint (V = 16.5--19
mag) standard stars, suitable for LSST and other wide-field photometric
surveys, and tied to HST and the CALSPEC system, defined by the three primary
standards, GD71, GD153 and G191B2B.
