The code has been tested on Python 2.7 and 3.6 on both OS X (El Capitan and
Sierra) and Liniux (Debian-derivatives). Send us email or open an issue if you
need help!

We're working on a publication with the results of our Cycle 22 and Cycle 20
data, while ramping up for Cycle 25! A full data release of Cycle 20 and 22 HST
data, and ground-based imaging and spectroscopy will accompany the publication.
Look for an updated link here!

TODO
----

-  More testing with a full testing suite
-  Add Rauch model atmospheres for comparison with Tlusty
-  setup.py
-  Push to PyPI
-  PUBLISH!

You can read the first version of our analysis of four of the Cycle 20
objects
`here <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1603.03825>`__

That analysis used custom IDL routines from Jay Holberg (U. Arizona) to
infer DA intrinsic parameters and custom python code to fit the
reddening parameters. This code is intended to (significantly) improve
on that analysis
